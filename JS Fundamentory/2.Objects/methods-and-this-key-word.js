// Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.
// Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().
// Methods can reference the object as this.
// The value of this is defined at run-time.

// When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.
// A function can be copied between objects.
// When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.
// Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.
